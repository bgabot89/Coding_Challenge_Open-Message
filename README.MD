# Coding Challenge for Open Message
Coding Challenge Repo for Open Message. Uses the Food2Fork API.

# About
Application allows user to input a food that they want to cook with. Food2Fork API randomly generates a recipe based on the specific food that is inputted. There is a second API integrated, punkAPI, which randomly grabs a drink, but I ran out of time could not correctly integrate it to the application.
